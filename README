Gopherize - A simple Web library for Go
---------------------------------------

Currently, main.go is just a sample of how to use gopherize. The library itself is in the src/gopherize directory.
Doesn't do much yet, features are below:

    func Connect(host string, port int) Gopherize

A simple interface to "Dial". Just pass it the host and port, it will then return a Gopherize object

    func Get(g Gopherize, page string) Gopherize

Will check to see if the given page exists. If not, the Err field will be populated with the relevant error.
If the get succeeds, then the Page field will change to the specified page and Err will be nil.
This function will always return a Gopherize object.

Gopherize - A simple Web library for Go
---------------------------------------

Currently, main.go is just a sample of how to use gopherize. The library itself is in the src/gopherize directory.
Doesn't do much yet, features are below:

    func Connect(host string, port int) Gopherize

A simple interface to "Dial". Just pass it the host and port, it will then return a Gopherize object

    func (g *Gopherize) Get(page string) (bool, error)

    ex: status, err := g.Get("/about")

Checks if the given page exists. Returns 'true' or 'false' boolean.

    func (g *Gopherize) Links() ([]string, error)

Returns a list of links on the current Gopherize page and any errors
